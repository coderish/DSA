# Spanning Tree
1. Undirected Weighted Graph having N nodes(vertices) and M edges 
2. A tree in which we have N Nodes and N-1 Edges is a Spanning Tree
3. In a spanning tree, all nodes should be reachable from one another.

# Minimum Spanning Tree
1. Of all the spanning trees, the tree having the lowest sum of all edge weights is an MST
