Bit Manipulation Technique
    - Convert a Decimal number to its representation
    - Find the number of pairs with odd XOR
    - Hamming Distance between two given integers
    - Number’s Complement – 2 Approaches
    - Count Set bits in a given Number
    - Multiply with power of 2 without using pow() or * operator
    - Check if Given Number is power of 2.
    - Swap two numbers using Bitwise XOR Operator
    - Divide with power of 2 without using pow() or / operator
    - Left Shift (<<) and Right Shift (>>) Operators
    - Convert Number to base 3 String Representation
    - Find two non-repeating numbers in an array in O(n) time and O(1) space
    - Number of bit to be flipped to convert one number to another.
    - All elements appears thrice and one element appears once. Find that element in O(n) time and O(1) space
    - Find the only element in array which appears only once
